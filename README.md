## GitHub Certification Program FAQs

**General:**

What is the GitHub Certification Program?
The GitHub Certification program partners with PSI to deliver certification exams in local test centers or online. GitHub certifications are an industry-endorsed approach to demonstrating proficiency with GitHub technologies. Earning a GitHub certification gives you the competitive edge needed in the market today by allowing you to promote your skills as a GitHub expert.

How can I join?
To join the GitHub Certification program, please visit our certification website. Here, you will find detailed information about the certifications we offer, as well as the registration process. We encourage you to explore the website to learn more about the program and how to get started on your certification journey.

Does the Certification program support Enterprise Managed User (EMU) accounts?
GitHub does not allow EMU accounts in the system due to several reasons. EMU accounts have many restrictions on GitHub, including limited access and visibility. We encourage users to use their personal GitHub accounts for certification purposes, as certifications will remain attached to their profiles even if they leave the company. Users that associate their work email with their personal GitHub account will automatically be joined to their parent organization. Users are free to use their corporate email and personal GitHub handle. For more information about the limitations with managed accounts, you can visit the following resource: [Abilities and restrictions of managed user accounts - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud/admin/user-management/about-enterprise-managed-accounts#abilities-and-restrictions-of-managed-user-accounts).

How can I tie my corporate email to my personal GitHub account?
To access any partner benefits, you need to first associate your partner company email address with your GitHub account. For example, if you work for Microsoft, please add your @microsoft.com email address to your GitHub account. Your company email address doesn’t need to be the primary email address associated with your GitHub account but it does need to be verified. To add your company email address to your GitHub account follow these steps:
1. Go to GitHub Settings
2. In the left column, under Access, click Emails.
3. In the Add email address text box, enter your company email, and then click Add.
4. Check your email for instructions on how to verify your email address.

Are there any prerequisites?
There are no required prerequisites. However, we recommend a working knowledge of GitHub and studying the learning modules on Microsoft Learn. For more information, please see the learning paths below.

Where can I find study materials for the exams?
GitHub offers a variety of self-paced learning content on Microsoft Learn. This content helps build necessary technical skills to advance your knowledge and ability to address solutions. These browser-based trainings are available to complete at your own pace. You can prepare for each exam by completing the associated learning path on Microsoft Learn:
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Administration
- GitHub Advanced Security
- GitHub Foundations

What is the expected response time for ticket inquiries?
The response time for ticket inquiries can vary depending on the nature of the issue and the workload of the support team. Typically, you can expect a response within 24-72 hours.

An online proctored exam requires the installation of a secure browser and reliable access to the internet.

GitHub certifications are currently valid for a minimum of three years. The exam refresh cycle depends on the evolution of each individual product, but on average, you can expect a new exam to be available approximately every three years. If a new exam has not been released in that timeframe, then we will work with our digital badging provider to extend the duration of the certification.

Sometimes this email can go to spam, so double-check there as well.

The exam refresh cycle depends on the evolution of each individual product, but on average, you can expect a new exam to be available approximately every two years.
